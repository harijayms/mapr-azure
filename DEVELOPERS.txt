BACKGROUND
	See www.mapr.com for details on the MapR Distribution for
	Hadoop and it's key differentiating features.


PROVISIONING MODEL
	Two different models are supported.  The default (captured
	in azuredeploy.json) loads the MapR Installer Service on 
	node0 of the requested infratructure and then executes
	an install on all provisioned nodes  using that serice.
	In this model, users can specify the cluster size along
	with the MapR version and license edition.

	Alternatively, you can use az_scripted.json that invokes
	a simple set of shell scripts to deploy a MapR M3 Edition
	cluster.   



TESTING
	The template makes heavy use of the github repository itself
	for accessing scripts and files during the deployment.  See
	the "scriptsUri refereence in azuredeploy.json.   To test
	your modifications, you'll most likely want to clone the
	repository and update the scriptsUri link to point to a 
	location over which you have complete control.
