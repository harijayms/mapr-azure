BACKGROUND
	See www.mapr.com for details on the MapR Distribution for
	Hadoop and it's key differentiating features.


PROVISIONING MODEL
	Two different models are supported.  The default (captured
	in azuredeploy.json) loads the MapR Installer Service on 
	node0 of the requested infratructure and then executes
	an install on all provisioned nodes  using that serice.
	In this model, users can specify the cluster size along
	with the MapR version and license edition.

	Alternatively, you can use az_scripted.json that invokes
	a simple set of shell scripts to deploy a MapR M3 Edition
	cluster.   



TOOLS
	The Azure command line toolkit is available from Microsoft
	  http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/xplat-cli/#configure

	The command-line tool has two modes : “resource” and “service” .   
	Most of our work is via “resource” mode, so you may need to do
		azure config mode arm          # asm for “service” mode

	Log in to your azure account with
		azure login

	
TESTING
	The template makes heavy use of the github repository itself
	for accessing scripts and files during the deployment.  See
	the "scriptsUri" refereence in template json docs (
	azuredeploy.json and az_scripted.json).   To test
	your modifications, you'll most likely want to clone the
	repository and update the scriptsUri link to point to a 
	location over which you have complete control.

	To create a cluster, first create a fully defined set of 
	parameters for you cluster.   This is done by copying 
	azuredeploy-parameters.json to a writable file (say, ap.json) 
	and editing it for the values you wish (cluster size, instance
	type, etc.).

	Those parameters are used as input to one of the deployment 
	templates with the command :
		azure group create <RGname> <AzureRegion> \
			-f [az_scripted.json | azuredeploy.json ] \
			-e ap.json \
			-d <DeploymentName>
